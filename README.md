# Planets-Simulation
A working model of our Solar System using real data from https://nasa.gov/.

Accurately simulates elliptical orbits and gravitational interactions of all eight planets and the Sun, using the radius of the planet, mass of the planet, orbital velocity of the planet, and its distance to the Sun.

## Requirements
- ```pygame``` module

## Instructions
- Up/down arrow keys to zoom in and out
- Right/left arrow keys to speed up or slow down the simulation
